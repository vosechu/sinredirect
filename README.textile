h2. Summary

Runs on a gateway server and sets the Host header for a request so that you don't have to set up a route to an internal firewalled server. Sometimes setting up a proper path through your router and your load-balancer is too much of a pain in the ass.

@http://<gateway server>/internal/<domain for host header>/<ip of target machine>/<path>@

h2. Caveat

This is essentially an open proxy so it would be wise to maybe keep it to yourself or implement some sort of password scheme.
